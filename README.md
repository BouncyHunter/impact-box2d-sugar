This v2.1a Box2D plugin is an adaptation of the plugin found [here](https://github.com/clok/PiSpace/tree/3f2900026b58d5fb97a8ea5621dfabd573af96d1/lib/plugins/box2d).

The following `Entity` functionally has been restored and behaves exactly how you'd expect it to: [.standing](http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#standing), [.touches](http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#touches), and [.gravityFactor](http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#gravityfactor)
